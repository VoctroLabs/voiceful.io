                          “El Plan B de Ballantine’s" Online Advertising Campaign by Pernod Ricard consisted of inviting the fans of a famous band (La Oreja de Van Gogh) to compose the lyrics for a new song using a mobile app. The users could hear how their own lyrics would sound by using the AI voice of the singer and share them with the band. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Voctro Labs developed the female Synthetic Voice Model and the online web service to convert the user lyrics into synthesized singing by the female virtual voice, conserving the singing expression and naturality of the band’s real singer.

                        <p>
                          In six months of campaign, more than 20.000 lyrics were received, and the song created afterwards, using user lyrics, arrived soon to the Top 10 music charts. The campaign was awarded with the first prize in “El Sol” advertising and communication festival.

                          Voiceful Studio (beta version) is Voctro Labs newest creation, motivated by a real need in the media content creation market. Thanks to a cheaper, faster and large scale media production and distribution, 300 hours of new video is being uploaded online every minute. However, we found this industry facing two important limitations. The first one is language, this variable is hindering access to a bigger audience. The second, is timing, some content is only relevant for a very short period of time. Imagine the case of online news video broadcasting services interested in spreading content around the globe. Adding subtitles or dubbing the video in a conventional way, on a small budget, would take long enough to make it irrelevant by the time it is published.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We are committed to expanding the horizons of your content, so we developed a voice generation, easy-to-use and cost-effective SaaS platform. It allows you to generate dubbed versions of audio-visual content in any language and in a short period of time. The new tool is able to impersonate all the emotive qualities of the original voice; or to create directly voice-over tracks for your video content.

                          Voiceful toolkit offers the option to designers to go beyond standard voice interaction in electronic devices. It is ideal for personalizing interactive products, innovative apps for voice assistants, internet of things devices and robotics. With the Voiceful toolkit you will be able to generate whether human like or fictional voices (monsters, aliens, witches and more), or generate a human-like artificial singing for music applications.

                          Having third parties (Alexa, Google Home, amongst others) automatic speech recognition (ASR) available, now humans can easily interact with machines through voice, granting new possibilities for either entertainment or professional purposes. Companies providing ASR enable organic access to speech-to-text for processing in our Standalone SDK and the possibility of granting a quick text-to-speech or text-to-song modified output.

                          In Voctro Labs we acknowledge and understand the future of Voice Assistants and so we develop voice tools for the industry. It is expected that in the next five years almost every appliance will integrate voice. Smart appliances are gaining more presence in everyday users’ life, with Voiceful tool kit companies will be able to give a voice to a brand persona and a familiar and easy recognizable voice through this new channel. Just imagine if your blog, newspaper or article could be read with a personalized voice through virtual assistants, providing differentiation and a clear personality to the brand.

                          Voctro Labs integrated singing voice synthesis technology and developed customized voices for the VA (Alexa and Google Home) app “Ditty” by Zya Music (USA). The application is for messenger mobile, it’s a fast and fun new way to send friends custom songs and lyric videos. The user picks a song from the music library, both classic and hits, and Ditty will sing your message with her own voice. Creations can be shared instantly via Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, SMS, email and more.

                        <p>
                          With the help of the ASR of the virtual assistant being used (Alexa or Google Home), speech will be converted to text. The Ditty application integrates Voiceful to convert this text into a song
